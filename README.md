Problem Statement
There are N stones arranged in a row. The i-th stone from the left is painted in the color Ci.

Mohit will perform the following operation zero or more times:

Choose two stones painted in the same color. Repaint all the stones between them, with the color of the chosen stones.
Find the number of possible final sequences of colors of the stones, modulo 109+7.


Problem Statement
You are given an integer N. Build an undirected graph with N vertices with indices 1 to N that satisfies the following two conditions:

The graph is simple and connected.
There exists an integer S such that, for every vertex, the sum of the indices of the vertices adjacent to that vertex is S.
It can be proved that at least one such graph exists under the constraints of this problem.

Constraints

All values in input are integers.
